                        This was our first outing flying UAS's in an official UASS capacity. Our ground station crew gained valuable experience in using Mission Planner
                        to operate a quadcopter, and we experienced what it was like to fly in the cold Alaska winter.
                        <br /><br />
                        The cold was followed by a hot meal at a nearby diner; it was a great opportunity for the team to get more familiar with one another. All in all,
                        the outing was a huge success, and is a great example of what makes this class so fun!
