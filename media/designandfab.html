                    Designing the layout for the S900 and the Stalker required finding places where everything fit together. The first step was
                    to compile all of the parts together. Since not all of the parts were in yet, we made some mock-up parts out of foam. This was
                    useful for showing a rough layout for the various subsystems.
                    <br /><br />
                    A foam CNC machine was very helpful in expediting making these mock-up parts. This CNC machine was also used by Patrick Dewane
                    to make custom airfoils for the Stalker.
