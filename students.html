                            Clayton serves as UASS’ Stalker Design Lead for the Stalker improvement effort. He is currently
                            an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Digital Electronics at the 
                            University of Alaska Fairbanks. His projected graduation date is May of 2017.
                            <br /><br />                         
                            Clayton’s work experience extends into several subfields of Electrical Engineering, but he initially 
                            started his forays into the industry through hardware and software modification of computer systems 
                            growing up in rural Wisconsin. Clayton’s most recent work pertains to battery management systems in remotely 
                            operated robotic systems, and has developed proficiency at embedded systems hardware design.
                            <br /><br />                            
                            In his free time Clayton enjoys the recreation opportunities that Alaska has to offer and has recently 
                            developed a love for mountaineering and back-country skiing.

                            with a focus on Communications from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
                            <br /><br />
                            He started working with the ACUASI 3 years ago, working with a team to produce a hexacopter
                            based on the DJI S800 airframe to be introduced into ACUASI’s fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
                            The final product of that design is now called the Ptarmigan and has become a mainstay of
                            ACUASI’s multi-rotor UAV fleet. Working at the Naval Research Labs in Washington D.C. he was
                            involved in cutting edge UAV research and development.

                            In his free time Logan is an avid UAV hobbyist. He enjoys designing and building UAVs for personal
                            use and is active with UAV hobby groups around town.

                            Zachary Krehlik is a god among men.  His prowess at a hockey rink is a thing of legends,
                            he turned down being picked in the first round of the 2006 NHL draft to pursue his 
                            interests elsewhere.  His fascination with electrical engineering STEMs from his late 
                            great uncle on his mothers side, Nikola Tesla.  Mr. Krehlik was a co-founder of PayPal and 
                            Tesla Motors, but opted to pursue a STEM degree for a more traditional entrance into the 
                            engineering industry.  A few of his accomplishments include slaying the Nemean Lion and 
                            the destruction of the Lernaean Hydra.

                            Zachary Krehlik is lifelong Alaskan.  In his free time, he enjoys hiking, kayaking, fishing, camping, and playing hockey. 
                            Zach is in his final year of the Electrical Engineering program with an emphasis in Power at UAF.  Nikola Tesla and 
                            Curiosity landing on Mars are two of the major influences on his choice to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering. 
                            After graduation his plans include getting a dog, finding more time to bike, and carving first tracks on fresh powder.​

                            Shoa Russel got her undergratuate degree at FSU. While there, she worked on a number of interesting projects.
                            These include: her senior design project, in which she lead a team that modified MIT's tin-can radar to measure the wing beat frequency of bird wings;
                            a simple robotic hand controlled with an Arduino Uno and flex potentiometers; and a video game built in VHDL and displayed over VGA, with an
                            enemy character that looked oddly similar to her teacher at the time.

                            Shoa Russell to college at FSU and was on the deans honors list my last two semesters there. 
                            Projects include:
                            Being the project lead for my Tin-Can Radar Senior design project in which we modified MITs tin-can radar design and worked with Detect to see if we could see the wing beat frequency of birds wings using the radar. 
                            Also build a simple robotic made from scratch using an Arduino Uno and flex potentiometers to mimic the movements of a gloved hand. 
                            And my favorite, built a video game in VHDL and displayed it using VGA, the game included multiple lives, levels, and characters. The "enemy" character looked oddly similar to my teacher at the time. ;)

                            Patrick serves as UASS’ S900 Design Lead for the S900 improvement effort. He is currently an 
                            undergraduate student in Computer Engineering with a projected graduation date of May 2016.
                            <br /><br />
                            Patrick’s experience with UAS begin while serving in the Army as an Imagery Analyst. He worked
                            with both the Sky Warrior and Hunter platforms in Balad as well as the Joint Surveillance Target
                            Attack Radar System (JSTARS) in Baghdad.
                            <br /><br />
                            While attending college he was selected to join the Modern Blanket Toss project as an instructor,
                            data manager and Geospatial Analyst. He is currently serving as data manager and Geospatial
                            Analyst for the Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA) on campus.

                            Patrick is very interested in using UAS to perform mapping tasks and is an expert at integrating
                            UAS generated data into existing GIS databases.
